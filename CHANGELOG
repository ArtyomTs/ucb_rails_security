= UCB Rails Security - Changelog


rel-2.1.0 Revamped Rdoc.  Added 2 new generators: ucb_security_initializer and ucb_security_models.  
ucb_security_initializer generates the rails initializer without all the scaffolding.  ucb_security_models
generates just the models.  Changed default log level to LOGGER::INFO.
